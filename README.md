# Data Science Project

This is a repository in which I have been compiling different projects that I have been developing for the last few years. In the project you would find statistical analysis, exporatory data analysis and machine learning and deep learning models. The most recent one is the Fraud Detection Project in which I have trained LightGBM, XGBoost, MLP and LSTM models.

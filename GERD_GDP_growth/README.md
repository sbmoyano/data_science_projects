### Data Science Project: Impact of R&D investment on GPD growth in OECD countries

In this project I will analyze how the investment in R&D (Research and Development) by private business has an impact on GDP (Gross Domestic Product) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. I will get data from the World Bank and OECD Databases.

I will visualize how private business investment in R&D has changed before (2005-2006), during (2007-2008), after (2009-2010) and 5 years after (2015) the economic crisis of 2007-2008.

Special attention will be paid on the periods before, during and after the economic crisis. I am specially interested to see if the investment made by private business in R&D in the previous years of the economic crisis (2005-2006) have a positive impact on the countries GDP during the economic crisis (2007-2008) or after (2009-2010). In this case, I will expect that the higher the investment of private business in the previous years of the economic crisis, the lesser the impact on the GDP.

* I will import the files, keep the relevant columns and clean the data.

* Normality assumptions will be tested based on graphs and statistical significance.

* In case of non-normal distribution of the data, I will apply the appropriate data transformation for statistical analyses.

* Correlation analysis will show us the associations between private business investment in R&D and countries GDP.

* Regression analysis will allow us to see if the country GDP could be predicted by private business investment in R&D.

***Note*. Regression models were only implemented using StatsModels and ScipyStats. By the time this notebook was created I was more interested in how to use Quantile Regression for my research on cognitive neuroscience. For a more "machine learning" and "deep learning" project, take a look at my project on fraud detection.**
